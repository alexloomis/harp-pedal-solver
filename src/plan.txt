What information do we need, and what information do we need to generate it?
Need for logic:
  Initial pedals
  Final pedals
  Pitches
Needed output:
  Starting pedal diagram
  End pedal diagram
  Spellings
  Pedal changes
Nice for good graphical output:
  Key sig
  Time sig/measures
Stretch for great graphical output:
  Two staff output
  Mixed rhythms

Library should take initial pedals, final pedals, and pitches,
return starting diagram, end diagram, spellings, changes.
The command-line binary can use this and measure information
to generate a lilypond file.
A separate gui application can use this to decorate a graphical entry.
